# New-World-Simple-Text-Based-Adventure-Game-
First project created for Berkeley City College's CIS 25 course Fall 2024. 

First, I chose to start off with the user's name to immerse them more in the experience. Wanted to tackle the edge case of misclicks so they the user doesn't have to restart the program in order to change their name.
